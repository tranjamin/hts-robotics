[-] make grasping more robust
    [-] option for doing a 180 rotation around local z to allow the gripper to reach further down
    [-] move initially to an offset pose, either above object or retracted from object
    [-] filtering method to select more efficient poses - possibly measure constrainness of the arm
[-] hts_main.cpp
    [-] figure out why applyPlanningScene() works on gripper close but not gripper open
    [-] move all messages into hts_msgs
[-] add colour to pointcloud
[-] re-enable orientation constraints and figure out how to make them robust
[-] investigate inefficiencies in pathing
[-] filter out robot geometry in pointcloud
[-] increase speed of gazebo arm
