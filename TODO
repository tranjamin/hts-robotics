- encapsulate all options for anygasp node into config file
    - anygrasp network options
    - additional offset and rotation options
    - filtering options
    - load from file option
    - debug options to show pointclouds
- make grasping more robust
    - option for doing a 180 rotation around local z to allow the gripper to reach further down
    - move initially to an offset pose, either above object or retracted from object
    - filtering method to select more efficient poses - possibly measure constrainness of the arm
- hts_main.cpp
    - figure out why applyPlanningScene() works on gripper close but not gripper open
    - move all messages into hts_msgs
- add colour to pointcloud
- re-enable orientation constraints and figure out how to make them robust
- investigate inefficiencies in pathing
- filter out robot geometry in pointcloud
